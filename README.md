# Basic of Kafka
Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that is used publish and subscribe to streams of records.

There are many things you need to know to starting kafka. Let's start.

1. **Kafka topic**:  
Kafka topic is base of everything. There is no topic, there is no kafka.Topic is a particular stream of data, like database. Every topic must have a name. Topic contain some buzzword.
    - Partitions: 
       Topics are split in partitions. Each partition are ordered by id, it called offset. Like partition 0, partition 1, ..... partition N.
    - Replication factor: 
      üôè *Before read this, please read about the broker.(recommended)* 

      Replication factor create broker for tracking data. It makes copy of data in multiple broker. If one of our broker goes down, other brokers will send data. When copy the data in broker, first broker became a leader and others brokers became In-Sync-Replica(ISR).
2. **Kafka broker**:    
 Previous section we learn about kafka topic. Now question is where topic store? Topics are store in broker. Simply Brokers are server. In kafka, there will have many brokers. Each broker are identify by their ids. Like Broker 1, Broker 2, ...., Broker N. Collection of broker became a kafka cluster. Each broker contains certain topic partitions, Not hole topic. Because kafka is distributed.
